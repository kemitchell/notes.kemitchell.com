- > But trademarks – whether a name, logo, or badge – are an extension of a project’s decision to be open source. Just as your project’s open source license demonstrates that your codebase is for free and fair use, an open source project trademark policy in keeping with the Open Source Definition gives everyone – upstream contributors and downstream consumers – comfort that they are using your project’s marks in a fair and accurate way.
- > Many people may not realize that the permission to use the project’s trademark is distinct from the project’s license for its source code.
- > To start, Angular, a web application framework for mobile, and desktop; Gerrit, web-based team code collaboration tool; and Istio, an open platform to connect, manage, and secure microservices, will be joining the Open Usage Commons, giving their trademarks a neutral, independent home that manages trademarks in line with the Open Source Definition.
- > The Open Usage Commons is something wildly new in open source, and in the spirit of the transparency that propels open source, we’ll be the first to tell you that the Commons intends to start small and walk before it runs.
