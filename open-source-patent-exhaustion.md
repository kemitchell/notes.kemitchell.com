- pile of crap: open source doesn't implicate exhaustion
- cases:
  1.  Quanta v. LG, 553 U.S. 617
      - can't use with non-Intel chips
  2.  Impression v. Lexmark (2017)
      - one-time-only ink cartridge
  3.  LifeScan v. Shasta, 734 F.3d 1361
      - meaning of "sale"
      - blood draws
      - giving things away still exhausts
  4.  Cascades v. Samsung, 70 F.Supp.3d 863
      - Android
      - virtual machine
  5.  Intel v. ULSI, 996 F.2d 1566
      - "have made"
- principles
  - exhaustion is not licensing
  - transfer of goods, not transfer or rights
  - any authorized transfer
    - e.g. XEROX PARC BSD without patent grant
    - even if you tell them you'll come after them
  - both systems and methods
  - reasonable and intended anternative uses --- not exhausted
  - disabling code --- not exhausted
  - distributed by licensee --- exhausted
    - could do under contract
- scenario:
  - Qualcomm buys AT&T handsets from retail
  - uses chips to make competing product
  - caveat: courts avoid surprising results
- open distribution systems
- find Linux distributions from all major patent holders on Linux
- Microsoft just boutght GitHub!

Q&A
- software alone can be a "good"
- no analysis of design patents
- McCoy: [Bowman v. Monsanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowman_v._Monsanto_Co.)
- eerily specific video codec hypo
