## Overview

A semi-chronological history of Section 230 legislation, court cases, and SESTA.  The vast majority is a kind of rote libertarian defense of 230's absolutism, which I get the sense the author can rattle off while dreaming.  Then, suddenly, late in the book, his view softens, and he explains how he came to support SESTA.

A few glaring flaws throughout:  While eventually acknowledging that more nuanced rules are possible, Section 230-like protection is treated as a yes-or-no proposition on many occasions.  The author utterly fails to make the case that 230 made the Internet, constantly mixing 230 and the DMCA.  Repeats the idea that Section 230 is a free-speech rule, even though speakers are themselves subject to the same old First Amendment speech-content rules.  Expects the reader to accept more or less at face value that companies are better regulators and moderators of speech than governments.
