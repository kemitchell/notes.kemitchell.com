  2.  listen to complaints

- users hated minimum title and post lengths
- character counter didn't help
- input validation UI didn't help
- nuclear: bouncy error dialogs next to inputs
- no more complaints
- doing this over and over took a year
- now cautiously accepting customers
- 90% of feedback will be terrible
- easier to imagine an expert swooping in and getting it all right
- get down and dirty in trenches with users for the valuable 10% of feedback
