- TL;DR: If the cloud didn't eat Hadoop Inc., Pivotal, and Red Hat, what explains their diminished prospects?
- software eats world
- open source eats software
- cloud eats open source
- multi-cloud eats cloud?
- some: open source eats cloud
- public clouds operate open source as a service
- "the clouds seem to make a better business from open source than the companies built around particular projects"
- "If you squint, open source could be seen as a very generous charitable donation to some of the largest and wealthiest corporations on the planet."
- playing fundamentally different games
- so much more than an instance of software
- operations underestimated
- open source skews to the complex
- knowing open software isn't moat
- coffee bean growers eating Starbucks?
- self-evident and glorious properties of open source
- religious faith

## AWS v. Open Source
- pluckily defiant blog posts
- frenzy of license engineering
- new open source Antichrist
- better from creators or good enough from AWS?

## "Fully Displaced"
- Peter Levine: over-rotated on the threat
- "some of the very largest OSS companies have recently lost sales momentum, valuation, and/or their independence"

## Hadoop
- Cloudera
- Hortonworks
- MapR
- Cloudera and Hortonworks merged
- MapR sold for scrap
- data lake customers didn't make money
- "no cloud era for Cloudera"
- alt: Hadoop just overhyped

## Pivotal
- amalgam of acquisitions
- incestuous bailout offer by VMware
- alt: eaten by Dockernetes
- alt: sold consulting, not cloud services

## Red Hat
- singleton existence proof
- poster child
- IBM middleware museum
- largest software acquisition ever
- took money implies didn't see a future in the cloud era
- took cash
- cloud relevance problem
- missed estimates for two quarters, then sold
- alt: management picked IBM as partner to take on cloud

## The End of History Usually Isn't
- open source now like Microsoft in early 2000s
- Open Source in not the End of History for software
- loose affinity between projects and companies
- Adapt or die.
- here to stay as development model
- services as primary delivery model
