- investment spike in open source
- MySQL in 2008: thought would be the biggest ever
- Red Hat going public price v. acquisition price
- OSS started as software for enterprise infrastructure
- renaissance
- fringe to epicenter
- virtuous cycle of technical and business innovation
- technical
  - speeds product feedback
  - drives adoption
  - reliability
- business innovation just as important
  - pay for support
  - open core
  - SaaS
- flywheel
- expect to continue
- pillars
  1.  product-community fit
    - early critical community mass
    - project leaders drive
    - becomes CEO
    - bias: fund leaders
  2.  product-market fit
    - organic adoption
    - download counts
    - leads to sales engagement
    - extension of your organization
    - delineate commercial value
  3.  value-market fit
    - revenue from value to the enterprise
    - departmental and enterprise buyers
    - measure: revenue
    - e.g. performance, auditing, services, RAS, tooling and add-ons
    - pitfall: too good, fully complete
- business models
  1.  support and services
    - Red Hat
    - hard to scale
    - Red Hat will become your competitor
  2.  open core
    - "differentiated licensing"
    - e.g. Elastic, Confluent
    - don't alienate open source
  3.  SaaS
    - e.g. Automattic, DataBricks
    - ideally, users don't distinguish hosted and open source
    - challenge: arouse big clouds
    - at maturity, clouds and licensing come up
    - too much energy early on
    - What is your competitive advantage?
    - not licensing up-front
    - over-rotated on concerns
    - Can you name a company fully displaced by a cloud provider?
    - Remember your competitive advantage.
      - enterprise customers don't want vendor lock-in
      - want to buy from those who wrote the code
      - big companies don't have your specific expertise
      - e.g. Zensource v. upstart competitor: "We're the folks who wrote the code." shut down the discussion
- licensing models
  - cites WhiteSource
  - early startups: don't overstress
  - figure out go-to-market first
- Building organization
  - devloper-driven, top-of-funnel exercise
  - open source functions built into business
  - connecting open source to business
  - developer evangelism
  - community ownership
  - community management
  - branding
    - same name? companies have succeeded both ways
      - confusion, dilution, licensing flexibility
      - drafting off open project, alienation of open source people
    - measure user registrations and downloads as evidence of use
    - You get what you measure.
    - product management for developer love
      - this is the bridge point
      - two roadmaps, open and closed
        - put on same slide
        - show interlock
      - have a clear framework for what will be open and closed
    - communications re: R&D
      - analytics and telemetry
      - KPIs on product usage predicting sales opportunities
      - experiment with bundling and unbundling
  - lead-gen and sales dev
    - outbound marketing: specific market segments
    - focus on specific buyers
    - sales dev: customer success approach
    - not overly salesy
    - filtering: sales qualified leads
  - purchase and expansion
    - self-serve and sales-serve
    - bottoms-up and tops-down
    - new logos and upsells
    - common failures
      - OSS user doesn't lead to a buyer
      - sales laps open-source growth
      - sales kills developer street cred
        - e.g. too many features
- chart: self-serve, field sales, inside sales at GitHub
  - one product tuned for each
- Open Source 3.0
  - e.g. AirBnB, Google make lots of releases
  - open source is eating software
  - market far bigger than realized so far
  - technology: AI, Blockchain, Data
  - business: ad-suppored, data-driven revenue, crypto tokens
  - big part of every company
