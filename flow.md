## Overall

A profoundly frustrating, rambling book that veers from studies based on issuing beepers that instruct participants to journal their thoughts on feelings to broad, philosophical generalities in the vein of self-help.  I found it fluffy when I was made to read it in school, and found it fluffy again when I make myself read it again, thinking I'd been too harsh.
