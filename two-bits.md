## Pointer

This is really two books in one.  If you find yourself dragging in Part I---the more academic, theoretical portion---skip to Part II.

Reading Part I took me months.  Reading Parts II and III took me two days.

- > Raymond was determined to reject the philosophy of liberty that Stallman and the Free Software Foundation represented, but not in order to create a political movement of his own.  Rather, Raymond (and the others at the Freeware Summit) sought to cash in on the rising tide of the Internet economy by turning the creation of Free Software into something that made more sense to investors, venture capitalists, and the stock-buying public.  To Raymond, Stallman and the Free Software Foundation represented not freedom or liberty, but a kind of dogmatic, impossible communism.  As Raymond was a committed libertarian, one might expect his core beliefs in the necessity of strong property rights to conflict with the strange communalism of Free Software---and, indeed, his rhetoric was focused on pragmatic, business-minded, profit-driven, and market-oriented uses of Free Software.  For Raymond, the essentially interesting component of Free Software was not its enhancement of human liberty, but the innovation in software production that it represented (the "development model").  It was clear that Free Software achieved something amazing through a clever inversion of strong property rights, an inversion which could be expected to bring massive revenue in some other form, either through cost-cutting or, Netscape-style, through the stock market.

- > The commitment to openness and the modulation of the meaning of source code thus create implications for the meaning of Free Software licenses: do such licenses cover this kind of content?  Are new licenses necessary?  What should they look like?  Connexions was by no means the first project to stimulate questions about the applicability of Free Software licenses to texts and documents.  In the case of EMACS and the GPL, for example, Richard Stallman had faced the problem of licensing the manual at the same time as the source code for the editor.  Indeed, such issues would ultimately result in a GNU Free Documentation License intended narrowly to cover software manuals.  Stallman, due to his concern, had clashed during the 1990s with Tim O'Reilly, publisher and head of O'Reilly Press, which had long produced books and manuals for Free Soft- ware programs.  O'Reilly argued that the principles reflected in Free Software licenses should not be applied to instructional books, be- cause such books provided a service, a way for more people to learn how to use Free Software, and in turn created a larger audience.  Stallman argued the opposite: manuals, just like the software they served, needed to be freely modifiable to remain useful.  By the late 1990s, after Free Software and Open Source had been  (256-257)

- promises and ideology  (302)

- > Often the first response to such emerging projects is to focus on the promises and ideology of the people involved.  On the one hand, claiming to be open or free or public or democratic is something nearly everyone does (including unlikely candidates such as the defense intelligence agencies of the United States), and one should therefore be suspicious and critical of all such claims.[^2]  While such arguments and ideological claims are important, it would be a grave mistake to focus only on these statements.  The "movement"---the ideological, critical, or promissory aspect---is just one component of Free Software and, indeed, the one that has come last, after the other practices were figured out and made legible, replicable, and modifiable.  On the other hand, it is easy for geeks and Free Software advocates to denounce emerging projects, to say, "But that isn't really Open Source or Free Software."  And while it may be tempting to fix the definition of Free Software once and for all in order to ensure a clear dividing line between the true sons and the carpetbaggers, to do so would reduce Free Software to mere repetition without difference, would sacrifice its most powerful and distinctive attribute: its responsive, emergent, public character. ---  (302)

- open access closer  (304)

- knowledge underlying consent of the governed  (305)

- > Several threads from the three parts of Two Bits can now be tied together.  The detailed descriptions of Free Software and its modulations should make clear that (1) the reason the Internet looks the way it does is due to the work of figuring out Free Software, both before and after it was recognized as such; (2) neither the Internet nor the computer is the cause of a reorientation of knowledge and power, but both are tools that render possible modulations of settled practices, modulations that reveal a much older problem regarding the legitimacy of the means of circulation and production of knowledge; (3) Free Software is not an ethical stance, but a practical response to the revelation of these older problems; and (4) the best way to understand this response is to see it as a kind of public sphere, a recursive public that is specific to the technical and moral imaginations of order in the contemporary world of geeks. ---  (306)

- turn market-based governance into a public sphere  (308)

- > Without Free Software, the only response to the continuing forms of excess we associate with illegitimate, unaccountable, unjust forms of governance might just be mute cynicism.  With it, we are in possession of a range of practical tools, structured responses and clever ways of working through our complexity toward the promises of a shared imagination of legitimate and just governance. ---  (310)
