- James C. Scott's _Seeing Like a State_

1.  look at a complex and confusing reality
2.  fail to understand subtleties
3.  attribute failure to irrationality
4.  concoct idealized, blank-slate vision
5.  argue relative simplicity and platonic orderliness of vision represents rationality
6.  impose the vision with authoritarian power
7.  watch it fail

- project subjective lack of comprehension onto object as irrationality
- desire for legibility
