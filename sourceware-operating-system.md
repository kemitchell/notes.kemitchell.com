- source form, royalty free Unix
- unifying the Unix desktop market
- provide substance to the many Unix unification and standard agreements
- Unix needs our help because Unix is dying.  Unix is no longer even close to competitive.
- redundant effort
- Windows is better
- 10 Unixes competing for 3% of market share
- Unix too expensive
- large, complex, bloated
- acrimonious
- 98% identical
- While Unix vendors agree to agree, Microsoft wins ...
- The vendors think "standards" are the answers.  The programmers think "free" software is the answer.  The customers think NT is the answer.
- customers have seen "standard" before
- If it can happen to IBM...
- energy on sourceware
- GNU, Sun RPC, Linux, X11, BSD, Cygnus
- Fixing Unmix is easier than living with NT.
- Microsoft will preserve its own dominance.  Saw when IBM a monopoly.
- Customers do not care what OS they run.  They care what applications they run.
- NetBSD runs applications for everything.
- Unix better for new OS research
- hackers
- Almost every good feature in computer operating systems today ... come from the mind of one hacker or another.  Typically, the work was not commissioned by a company.  It was done as a research project and then productized.  Without these people, we make no forward progress.
- can not be bought
- hackers ... uninterested ... anything other than sourceware
- figure out a way to allow the business world and the hacker world coexist and benefit one another
- 1.  be much smaller, focus on running as many applications as possible
  2.  available in source form
- server features N/A desktop
- fear of compatibility problems
- naive applications, not those using oddities
- vendors use the smallest interface possible, to ease porting
- if you don't know why it is there, then take it out
- boot new kernels on old hardware
- The availability of Unix source will grow the market and attract the best people to Unix development.
- Sourceware is software that is either copylefted or is at least freely redistributable.
- Sourceware is not really zero cost software, it is accessible software.
- companies making money
- support
- It is taken as a given that there will be problems with software and someone needs to be constantly available to address these problems.
- Hackers make up less than 1% of the customer base and only a hacker will be interested in unsupported software.
- Cygnus Support
- NASA: if it isn't source, it isn't software
- Sun's X terminal
- devs want to do something new, now duplicate effort
- manage copyright issues with Sun & Novell
- Sun funding Spring royalty-free OS
- Novell owns Unix. Only Novell can set Unix free.
- use something similar to GNU copyelft
- move past BSD lawsuits
- copyright to some non-profit
- Usenix, FSF, or UC Boulder
- X/Open for standards and branding
- Theoreticians make poor architects.
- The alternative is Linux...

## Q&A
- patches back: copyleft
- value-add: proprietary applications and kernel modules

## Summary
- changing the rules
- business model changing
- arguing amongst ourselves
