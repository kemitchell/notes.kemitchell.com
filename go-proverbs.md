- game of go: easy to learn, hard to master
- hard to teach westerners holistic strategy
- book: Go Proverbs Illustrated
- Can you have Go language proverbs?
- very, very wet stuff
- Don't communicate by sharing memory.  Share memory by communicating.
- Concurrency is not parallelism.
- Channels orchestrate.  Mutexes serialize.
- The bigger the interface, the weaker the abstraction.
- if you come from Java, where everything is bigger, ...
- culture of small interfaces
- most important interfaces: `io.Reader`, `io.Writer`, `interface{}`
- average: 2/3 of a method
- Make the zero value useful.
- e.g. bytes buffer, mutex
- don't have to init
- end up in lots of structures
- less API
- `interface{}` says nothing.
- nothing enforced on callers: might as well program in Python
- `map[string]interface{}` the least useful data structure
- map of names for meaningless objects
- way overused
- gofmt's style is no one's favorite, yet gofmt is everyone's favorite.
- Who cares?  Shut up!
- even the author doesn't like the style
- common favorite feature
- A little copying is better than a little dependency.
- Google: "we really care about code reuse" scary
- Google still suffering from decision
- even stdlib copies a few bits
- tests check agreement between implementations
- Cgo must always be guarded with build tags.
- If you're calling C, God knows what it does...
- very, very nonportable
- open source community made sure C less portable over time
- Cgo is not Go.
- favorite feature connecting to C
- a trap
- I've never used cgo.  I've never wanted to.
- 90% of Google crashes: cgo or swig
- With the unsafe package there are no guarantees.
- Clear is better than clever.
- programming in general
- no density premium
- Reflection is never clear.
- It doesn't work because it's not for you.
- Very difficult to use.
- impenetrable code
- hate it
- Errors are values.
- Why write `if err != nil` all the time?  You're not programming.  Just writing code.
- blog: Japanese programmer struggling
- not a try-catch surrogate
- they're just values
- Don't just check errors.  Handle them gracefully.
- don't return up the tree and forget about it
- Design the architecture.  Name the components.  Document the details.
- may be total BS
- good names make structure clear
- names carry fair bit of weight
- Documentation is for users.
- what is the function _for_?
- think of yourself as a user, not the writer
- just write prose

- proverbs may be contradictory
- mail them to me
- community around a certain way of programming
