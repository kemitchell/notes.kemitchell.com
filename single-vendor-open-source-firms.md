- models
  - service and support
    - don't own IP
    - existing software
    - no VC
  - distributors
    - assembly
    - own non-core IP
    - can attract VC
  - single-vendor
    - release some or all
    - keep IP
    - can attract VC
    - common in SV
- dual licensing a strategy, not a model
- open core
  - "IP modularity"
  - modules: licenses
  - community edition
  - commercial/enterprise edition
- pioneers: MySQL, Sleepycat, Trolltech
- second wave (c. 2002-08): SugarCRM, MuleSoft, Jaspersoft
- current (2008-): Mongo, Confluent, RedisLabs
  - cloud
  - sell to developers, not users
- open source to drive adoption
- sources:
  - usage rights
  - guarantees
  - support
  - training
  - consulting
  - ops
- "operations" := put into the cloud
- sales shows benefits
  - provide open source
  - track users (downloads)
  - connect users
  - generate leads
  - identify champion
  - make sales call
- challenge in structuring
  1.  maximize conversion to paying
  2.  benefit from user community
  3.  keep competition at bay
- What do I release? What do I keep?
- crippleware
- withholding
- throttling
- segmenting
- minimum: stay on top of IP
- [ ] The Intellectual Property Rights Imperative
- only you can license under terms of your choice
- contributor agreements: relicensing right
- reciprocal public license
- limits outside contributions
- not as bad as it sounds
- development cost < sales, marketing
- adoption, not development cost min.
- reciprocal becoming less important
- AGPLv3: competitors will stay away
- playbooks
- workflows
- best practices
- interviewing companies
- licensing changes
  - Who? What? From? To?
  - Mongo: core from AGPL to SSPL (2018)
  - Confluent: extensions from Apache to CCL (2019)
  - Redis: extensions from AGPL to RSAL (2019)
  - YugaByte: extension from commercial to Apache (2019)
- discriminatory licenses
- "viral"
- Open Source Definition
- just commercial vendors
- YugaByte went exactly the other way
  - relatively new challenger
  - crowded market
  - withholding their own cloud management tooling and configuration
- Redis Labs map out three categories
  - BSD
  - RSAL
  - Redis Enterprise License

- challengers v. incumbents
- relicensors selling to developers
- Mongo
  - community server
  - connectors and drivers
  - cloud management
- shims around virally licensed cores
- e.g. database connectors and drivers
- Mongo feared large cloud providers.
- all believe real money is in the cloud, long term
