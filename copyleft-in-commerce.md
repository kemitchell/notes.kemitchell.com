- "Copyleft has always been commercial"
- "The Free Software Foundation was funded by selling source code tapes."
- Australian military: $0 invoice
- worked a5t SGI
- Red Hat killed the idea of GPL as noncommercial
- "good old GPLv2"
- terrified corporate lawyers
- SAMBA one of earliest v3 adopters
- 2007:
  1.  Microsoft-Novell end run around GPLv2 section 7
  2.  software patents
  3.  DRM
- quit Novell for Google over Microsoft-Novell deal
- "please delete the previous e-mail"
- NetApp v. Tux filesystem with patents
- bothered most by DRM
- Microsoft-Novell:
  - patent indemnification pact
  - covenant not to sue
  - change royalty on Suse seats
  - didn't really matter
  - companies violate section 7 all the time
  - patent cross-licenses under NDA
  - Microsoft has changed
  - money makes the world go 'round
- software patents:
  - feared personal lawsuits
  - Scott Peterson: "You don't have any money!"
  - suffered nomore than software generally
  - universities close to NPEs
- costs of GPLv3 adoption for SAMBA:
  - Apple objected to new patent clause, but didn't offer any different language
  - Apple pulled SAMBA, replaced
  - only vendor saying so publicly
  - probably lost a few code contributions
  - Microsoft lost antitrust, published full protocols, beyond required
  - proprietary vendors: No GPLv3!
  - bought out (EMC, NetApp) to replace home-grown implenetations
  - terminated support contracts
  - "Thank you for ridding me of this turbulent priest."
  - cost us, but recovered
- DRM:
  - Joss Wedon's The Big Bad
  - Vernor Vinge's A Deepness in the Sky and Rainbow's End
  - "user" to "renter"
  - ink cartridges, John Deere, media
  - SHAME ON YOU W3C...
  - an act of vandalism
- GPLv3:
  - not much help
  - a little
  - has led to opening, usually via Developer Mode switch
  - educate vendors about open user communities
  - e.g. routers, SamiGO TV
- helping vendors:
  - partnership
  - legal and technical help offered
  - Conservancy laywer conference calls about their goals
  - also programmer and user
  - commodity, mature market
  - everyone is good enough
  - heresy:made change sto make easier to make and keep proprietary
  - amateur programmer's day over
  - paid contributors
  - try to work with engineers, directly
  - usually don't like closed, DRM
  - erach out early
    - design v. redesign
  - encourage upstreaming
    - great success rate
    - priority reviews
  - stand by your principles
  - most coprporate lawyers haven't read it
  - don't be too judgmental
    - Hollywood: have to have DRM, go elsewhere
    - be willing to walk away
  - very rare that violators malicious
    - just clueless
- distribute your copyright ownership
- preferred individual to corporate copyright contributions
- Microsoft: avoid exposing patents
- avoid corporate capture
- Kernel close to corporate-owned
- dves on payrolls don't want enforcement!
- certificate of ownership
- violator had bought a company
  - shipping in three weeks
  - major contributors allowed
  - next release, do it right
  - third party tried to assert
  - wanted to stop them distributing a product
- faith in individual developers
- users don't understand DRM alternatives
- kernel hackers now agaiunst GPL, e.g. Greg Kroah-Harman
- GPLv3 dev is a GPLv2 dev who runms across a locked-down device
- be nice when they change their mind
- small amoutns of GPLv3 software can have massive effects if important enough
- glibc: Why not GPLv3?
  - they're frightened
  - clang-GCC
  - will happen to glibc anyway!

## Q&A
- projects vulnerable to corporate capture?
  - decisions taken out of developer hands
  - project direction
  - e.g. Linux
