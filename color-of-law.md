## Overall

A compelling survey of systematic discrimination against African Americans in the United States, not so compellingly framed as a broad argument for "de jure" segregation.  Examples come from all around the country, but the book is particularly rich in San Francisco Bay Area examples, and particularly easy to recommend to readers there.
