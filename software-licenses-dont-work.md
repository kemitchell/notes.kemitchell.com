- > Amazon is built with Perl on top of Linux.  It's basically a bunch of open source hackers, but they're working for a company that's as fiercely proprietary as any proprietary software company.

  > What's wrong with this picture? Well, one thing is that one of the fundamental premises of open source is that the licenses are all conditioned on the act of software distribution, and once you're no longer distributing an application, none of the licenses mean squat.

  > I would go further than the fact that the licenses don't work.  I would also point out that these applications are fundamentally different in that their interfaces are composed much more of data than they are of just software. My basic premise is, "Let's stop thinking about licenses for a little bit. Let's stop thinking that that's the core of what matters about open source. And that's not to say that they're completely unimportant, it's just that they can blind (us) to other things that are perhaps more important.

- commoditization of software

- comparison to PC hardware market and Dell

- IBM Websphere as the Compaq value-added model

- Compaq didn't fail, but Dell was better

- open source stack not mature enough yet

- > The value will be driven up the stack to data.

- > somebody gets a critical mass of customers and data and that becomes their source of value

- > Amazon really understands that they are becoming a platform.
