- "surprising unintended consequences"
- "_proprietary relicensing_ has spread widely and --- for stronger copyleft licenses like Affero GPL --- has become the more common usage of the license."
- MySQL AB
- "collect all copyright control of a codebase"
- loss-leader
- "Non-commercial users generally are ignored, and commercial users often operate in fear of captious interpretations of the copyleft license.  The remedy for their fear is a purchase of a separate proprietary license..."
- first mixed FOSS/proprietary business model
- "toxicity"
- exclusive focus
- "aggressive copyleft license overreading and inappropriate, unprincipled enforcement"
- MongoDB
- companies banned AGPL because of Mongo
- any tool can be a weapon
- Aladdin Ghostscript
- "barely legitimate"
- "selling exceptions"
- "In practice, however, every company I'm aware of that sought to engage in 'selling exceptions' eventually found a more aggressive and lucrative track."
- MySQL tried to hire Bradley as a consultant
- scare tactics
- Black Duck tried to hire Bradley
- blowing minor violations out of proportion
- AGPL seen as toxic
- "discourages contributions from a broad community"
- "Neither users nor co-developers benefit from copyleft protection."
- drafting even more restrictive licenses
- Mongo wouldn't take its own license
- "The message of 'technically it's a FOSS license, but don't use' is too complicated to be meaningful."
- Fontana
- copyleft-next clause preventing dual licensing
- "the community should reject any new copyleft license without a clause that deflates the power of proprietary relicensing"
- working on an exception that works for any copyleft license
- "we now know that proprietary relicensing does not serve or extend software freedom, and in most cases has the opposite effect"
