- "Everything you make in Dreams is inside of Dreams. You cannot liberate your project from the Dreams."
- platform
- "Dreams isn’t an artistic commune because nothing you build can leave."
- "though it taps into all of these pre-existing ways we have of talking about art, in reality it’s a lot like something completely different: social media platforms."
- "liberated as videos or live streams or images that make it to social media or articles from journalists who are commenting on how cool things made in Dreams are"
- "Dreams wants you to be creative and explore whatever you want to do, and it also wants to sell copies of itself so that people will enjoy the labor you have put into your creations. In the same way that we are allowing Twitter to monetize our every thought when we tweet, we are literally allowing Dreams to monetize our creativity when we make things with it."
- platformization
- "standard recreations of familiar things"
- "Dreams sells you on the idea that you can create anything, but people seem to be overwhelmingly recreating the same media that they are already consuming in other parts of their life."
- "show off cool creations credited only to Dreams"
- "The people doing the work are not going to be the people benefitting materially from this game. "
