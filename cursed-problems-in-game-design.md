- player promises := a game's essential experiences, why the player came to play
- cursed problem := an unsolvable design problem, rooted in a conflict between core player promises
- example: beat 'em up + fighting game
- politics := competition through social negotiation, alliances, and manipulation
- find best player and ally against them
- politics becomes the core skill
- combat mastery -> no politics, play to win -> need politics
- Smash Brothers party game
  - randomization
  - chaos
- Quarterbacking Problem in turn-based cooperative games
  - one player coordinates everyone's actions
  - play to win via centralized decision making
  - lose player independence
- Skill Inflation Problem in evergreen competitive games
  - audience matures with game
  - less skilled players leave, can't break in
  - long journey of mastery v. vibrant community
- jigglypuff in Smash not cursed
- Hard or Cursed?
  - No Man's Sky: exploration with millions of planets
    - hard, not cursed
    - year-in patch satisfied expectations
    - so much work
  - Diablo 3 auction house
    - loot with efficient trading
    - commerce fantasy
    - cursed: varied loot drop contradicts fungibility of items
    - every monster just spawning gold
    - Commodified Reward Problem
  - Pokemon Go
    - always-on, location-based games
    - cursed: play anywhere contradicts play when appropriate, play safely
    - safety, mindfulness, convenience
    - Life Disruption Problem
- experience v. objective problems (special case of cursed problems)
  - experience: combat mastery
  - objective: play to win
- path from start through play space to objective
- objectives pull players through play space
- techniques
  1.  barriers: cut affordances that break promises
    - FFA: limit agency over other players
    - battle royale: too spread out, combat too lethal to play politics
    - sacrifice fantasy of control over others
  2.  gates: hide bad states behind challenges
    - limit visibility of player success
    - e.g. hiding scores on screen
    - sacrifice buzzer-beater drama
  3.  carrots: incentivize avoiding bad states
    - meta-game effects
    - Settles of Catan tournaments score with performance points, not just wins
    - sacrifices individual game stakes
  4.  s'mores: make it fun to violate promises
    - give tools for political play, e.g. secrecy
    - Diplomacy makes people hate each other
    - sacrifice: moment-to-moment actions lose importance in favor of relationships
- general-purpose design techniques
- structure for difficult creative process
- examples:
  - coop abuse:
    - high-stakes coop games lead to terrible player abuse
    - play to win versus social belonging
    - Humans think games are fair when they win 70% of the time.
    - barriers:
      - limit player communication
      - e.g. Journey, Apex Legends
      - sacrifice rich social relationship building
    - gates:
      - limit individual responsibility
      - e.g. Heroes of the Storm shared gold pool
      - e.g. Werewolf, Mafia, social deduction games
      - sacrifice harmonious cooperation, Ocean's 11 fantasy
  - quantified creativity:
    - Sims 4 creative, with goals
    - express myself v. draw in with a goals and progressions
    - intrinsic v. extrinsic goals
    - extrinsic goals subsume intrinsic 
    - successful long-term because people ignore extrinsic goals
    - carrots:
      - concrete reasons to be creative
      - Clash of Clans: playing off-meta leads to more wins
      - Alpha Bear: spelling weird words, mad lib at end
      - sacrifice unconstrained creativity
    - s'mores:
      - rich, deep goals
      - e.g. Civilization (versus Sim City)
- can seek out cursed problems
- highest-hanging fruit, ripest opportunities
- challenges:
  - balanced player-generated content in multiplayer
  - PvP where everyone feels outcome is just
  - mystery and discovery in the Internet age
