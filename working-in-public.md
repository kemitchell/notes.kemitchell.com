# Notes

## Introduction
- "Until recently, information was good, and more information was better." (7)
- "spirit of openness" for 200 years (7)
- "DDoSing one another" (7)
- open source nearly synonymous with public collaboration (7)
- funding only part of problem (8)
- diminishing returns of popularity (8)
- default: maintainer needs to find more contributors (9)
- initiatives attract low-quality contributions (9)
- too many contributors, or wrong kind (9)
- "Open source code is public, but it doesn't have to be participatory..." (10)
- few devs, many casual contributors (11)
- not the Internet pioneers' vision (11)
- "Node Package Manager" (12)
- curation over collaboration (12)
- too much participation, not consumption, overwhelms maintainers (13)
- distributed communities smashed together by social media platforms (14)
- "decline of the firm as a principal agent of change" (16)
- creators, not communities (16)

### Chapter 1
- "Hacker culture still lives today, in the way that beatniks, hippies, and Marxists still exist..." (24)
- successors: cryptographers? security people? (24)
- unflattering portraits: RMS, ESR, Linus (24-25)
- "Startling lack of interest in its people" (26)
- freedom from the people who make it (26)
- "today's developers hardly even notice 'open source' as a concept anymore" (28)
- "Copyleft ... like a virus ..." (29)
- "the classic technology tale of convenient triumphing over personal values" (30)
- convenience over freedom or openness (30)
- talent agency analogy (32)
- JavaScript (35)

- humble v. earlier generation (37)
- juxtaposition: Linus flipping the bird and Sindre cuddling huskies (38)
- shrink away from celebrity (38)
- "shifted from celebrating heavy-handed authoritarianism to seeking out thoughtfulness and stewardship" (39)
- "Open source was founded on the idea that developer's shouldn't be beholden to a particular platform." (40)
- "perfect storm of drive-by users" (41)
- "designed for a use case that's breaking down at scale" (41)

### Chapter 2
- charismatic megafauna (43)
- "there is no 'open source community', really, anymore than there is an 'urban community'" (44)
- "'Open source' projects have nothing more in common with one another than 'companies' do." (Zuegel) (44)
- setuptools → Distribute → merged back (48)
- bug reports, feature requests, questions (51)
- sync. & async. comms. (52)
- closed → open → closed or distributed development, depending on size (53)
- promote projects like startups (53)
- filter out noise or distribute work (55)
- contributor growth factors:
  - technical scope
  - support required
  - ease of participation 
  - user adoption (56)
- Babel's Phabricator experiment (57)
- older, messy codebases can create small, dedicated groups (59)
