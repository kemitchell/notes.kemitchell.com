## Talk
- other events taken over by "interests"
- people always want to hear about copyleft
- the whole story
- "politics"
- charity, not company or trade association
- SFC the most transparent org in teh space
- liberal arts college for CS
- had never owned his own computer until college
- comp.os.minix
- saw Linus' post
- "hobby"
- "profession"
- never submitted tiny Linux patches upstream
- Emacs
- saw GPL
- no definition of copyleft at that time
- copyleft a "strategy", not a principle
- copyleft not a moral imperative
- can't analyze alternative universes where all software GPL'd
- "truthiness"
- OpenWRT
- Rob Landley
- Rob: never got a good upstreamed patch out of BusyBox enforcement
- downstream become upstream developers
- common misconception about GPL
- compilation and installation
- Matthew Garrett
- the kids today
- Linux (Android) phones without source code
- didn't sue Linksys and Cisco right away
- dev sued anyway, without Brad
- as Linux was rising
- lawsuits regularly since 2002
- GPL a reason Linux succeeded
- bet:  Find one GPL violation a day.  Succeeded.
- people chose GPL because they wanted software freedom for their users.
- Herald no longer enforcing
- He was right about suing people.
- community enforcement principles
- last resort
- edge case: knowing, willful, longtime violators
- company reps most upset by lawsuits
- PACER lawsuit counts
- donors: should be making money and rolling it forward
- all Linux enforcement: not a single company in compliance yet, after five years
- proprietary kernel modules
- not asking or taking payment from any violators
- have to ask for donations
- Karen and I don't _like_ GPL enforcement.
- can only work at SFC or FSF
- Copyleft is not magic pixie dust.
- back-end process
- talking a lot about what critics say
- code and licenses ephemeral
- Linux has been rewritten dozens of times
- SFC agency for all of you
- do what devs ask us to do
- company: Their plan is to violate anytime you're not looking.
- most important: keep your own copyrights
- SFC release addressing US immigration changes
- feedback sessions at events
- almost all feedback positive
- sneaky political attacks all the time
- best guess: afraid
- free software would win overnight if devs woke up and swore never to write another line of proprietary code
- developers should choose their own licenses
- exciting technical problems distract you from policy

## Q&A
1.  - false dichotomy: money from violators OR donations
    - Do ask for costs of compliance enforcement.
    - can't get code without suing
    - Hoped German system would be faster.  Not so.
2.  - developer completely disagrees with SFC
    - Don't sign one of our enforcement agreements.
3.  - GPLv3 termination clauses for GPLv2
    - BusyBox: asked for costs
    - underestimated intransigence, readiness to go to court
    - VMWare could have rewritten to avoid kernel code
    - not revenue coming in, so please donate
4.  - attract lawyers without software backgrounds?
    - four on staff, two have law degrees
    - not many lawyers go to work for charities
    - "A lot of people go to law school to get rich."
5.  - public list of active violators?
    - BusyBox did this with Hall of Shame
    - principle: confidentiality
    - most violators have no clue
    - public shaming
6.  - GPLv2 paragraph 2
    - distributing phone
    - GPLv2 app in user space
    - question of copyright regime governing
    - by design
    - judo move of copyleft: as strong as copyleft is, we use that against
    - derivative works
    - complaint: creates uncertainty, you won't tell us
    - RMS: Want maximum popularity? Use non-copyleft. Want maximum freedom? Use strongest copyleft available.
    - "Tell us how much we can oppress you."
