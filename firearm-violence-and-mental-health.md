# Wintemute
- mass shootings: relatively few people
- at current rate, we could fill an Arlington Cemetery with civilian gun deaths every 12 years
- mass shootings: don't fit in a narrative that excludes us
  - not our kind of people
  - not the bad part of town
  - not easy to avoid
- more gun deaths than WWII casualties
- more deaths that casualties of all other US wars except WWII
- firearm suicides outnumber homicides
- motor vehicle deaths declined after data-driven policy making
- firearm homicide: young black men
- firearm suicide: middle-aged and elderly white men

- risk approach
- population health approach
  - e.g. heart attacks
  - because population so large, most adverse events happen to people of low risk
- from risk to burden
- from death rate to number of deaths
- combination strategy:
  - some measures risk-based
  - some affect everybody
- burden: white people hit hard
- from mid-30s, most deaths from firearms among white men
- mental health little correlated to interpersonal violence
- mental health very related to suicide
- California has had background checks for nearly every transfer for twenty years
- this doesn't work if you don't know at time of purchase whether the person is a member of high-risk group
- 40% of transactions don't involve a licensed retailer
  - no background check
  - no waiting period
  - "There's always a handshake."
  - "If I'm a prohibited person, that's how I buy guns."
  - "straw purchase"
- parallel tracks
- "You can go through security, or not, and you get to decide. That's how this works for guns."

##  Alcohol
- "boy, do we love to drink in this country"
- 50m report that they own firearms
- rate of gun ownership not changing
- projections of binge drinking and chronic heavy drinking firearm owners
- but firearm drinkers drink more than general population
- acute intoxication
  - 34% homicide perpetrators
  - 25.7% suicide
  - 30.2% homicide victims
- California considered bill prohibiting purchase by those with provable history of alcohol abuse (DUIs) (SB 755, Wolk)
- governor vetoed it --- no evidence
- "We're in the evidence business."
- "up to our ass in alligators"

# Barnhorst
- pie chart: tiny green sliver of public mass shooting victims
- quick to attribute mass shootings to mental illness
- presumption of mental illness
- increases stigma against mental illness
- mentally ill not significantly higher risk of violence
- much more likely to be victims than perpetrators
- specific circumstances
  - beginning of psychotic illness, especially young males
  - period around psychiatric hospitalization
    - but hospitalization used for dangerous people
- major mental disorders: 2.24 increased risk of committing act of violence
- substance abuse
  - independent risk factor
  - alcohol, stimulant abuse
  - confounding: increased substance abuse among those with mental illness
- substance abuse, no mental illness: OR 6.8 (increased risk of violence)
- substance abuse a much bigger risk factor than severe mental illness
- cumulative risk for both substance abuse and mental illness (OR 9.78)
- suicide strongly correlated with mental illness (OR 6.7)
- lots of legislation aimed at mental health
- not an effective way to rise up against our government
## Laws
### Federal
- Gun Control Act of 1968
  - out of assassination of JFK
  - mail ordered the rifle to his PO box
  - regulates owners and industry
  - licensure of all retailers
  - "prohibited persons"
    - felons
    - controlled substance users/addicts
    - domestic violence restraining orders
    - "adjudicated as a mental defective"

  - after attack on Reagan
  - trying to impress Judy Foster
  - James Brady wounded and paralyzed
  - national background check system
  - National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) database
  - run by FBI
  - very hard for states to figure out how to report
  - as of 2012: 30 states not reporting mental health records
  - reporting is still voluntary
### 
- prohibited if admitted to hospital for dangerousness
  - even in emergency observational period
- Tarasoff warning (admitted to therapist that thinking about committing violence against someone else)
- court-ordered voluntary or assisted outpatient treatment

## Does it work?
- examples of mass shootings where skimmed the mental health system

- Seung-Hui Cho (Virginia Tech)
  - earlier convicted of stalking two female students
  - outpatient treatment
  - state was one of the best at uploading mental health records
  - only ruled dangerous
  - records never uploaded
  - bought several weapons, passed NICS

- Jared Loughner (Gabby Giffords)
  - likely was in beginning of psychotic illness
  - recently expelled for bizarre behavior
  - officers had called parents and advised to remove firearms
  - parents took away shotgun, disabled his car at night
  - fake space flights, controlling people through grammar and syntax, printing fake currency
  - never made it into psychiatric treatment, because never had to go involuntarily
  - had been arrested for drug possession, but wasn't a felony, charges dropped
  - passed NICS inspection at gun shop

- James Holmes (Aurora)
  - no prior criminal record
  - had been seeing a psychiatrist
  - increasingly scary to her
  - homicidal thoughts discussed in therapy
  - never revealed plan to her
  - considered putting on involuntary hold, but might exacerbate
  - reported to security
  - passed NICS

- Erin Alexis (Washington DC Navy Yard)
  - behavior problems in Navy
  - honorably discharged, but for behavioral problems
  - had he been dishonorably discharged, would have been disqualified
  - run-ins with police due to hotel stay in RI
  - concerned about microwaves through walls to deprive of sleep, listening devices in hotel room
  - called police when room not switched
  - passed VA background check

- not representative of bulk of mass shooters
- angry young men, history of bullying, feelings of social isolation
