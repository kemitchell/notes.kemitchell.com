## Notes

- track-and-hook approach replaces melody-and-lyrics (200)

- topliners, usually women, are almost never given points (205)

- "Ek's answer to the question to whether Spotify is good for artists tends toward the tautological. If it's good for listeners---and almost everyone who uses Spotify likes it---then it must be good for artists, because by encouraging more listening it will 'increase the over-all pie.'" (295)

- "At least Ribot and Cash can go on the road. Nonperforming songwriters don't have that option." (297

- "Kesha dropped her sexual assault case against Dr. Luke in California, but pressed on with what remains over the contract dispute in New York." (314)
