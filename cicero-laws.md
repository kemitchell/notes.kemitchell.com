## Quotes

> As for 'adopting a spirit of holiness' and 'setting aside wealth', that means that goodness of character is pleasing to God, and that extravagance should be given no place.  After all, we would like poverty to be on an equal footing with wealth even among men, so why should we make it impossible for poverty to approach the gods by making extravagance a feature of our ceremonies, especially as nothing is likely to be less pleasing to God himself than that the path to appeasing and worshiping him should not be open to all. (132)

> But legal experts, whether to cause confusion and so give the appearance of having a wider and deeper knowledge than they do, or (more probably) through their incompetence at putting the subject across (for an art is not just a matter of knowing something; it is also a matter of communication) often endlessly subdivide a thing which is based on a single idea. (141)

> As magistrates are subject to the laws, the people are subject to the magistrates.  In fact it is true to say that a magistrate is a speaking law, and law a silent magistrate. (150)
