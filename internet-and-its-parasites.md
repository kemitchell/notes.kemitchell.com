## Parasitism
- save free/open from itself
- trapped in narrative
- concepts &rarr; technologies
- associations:
  - piracy, hacking
  - unsustainability business models, bad capitalism
- not a special community
- don't individualize the community
- parasites
- T. gondii
  - change rat brains
  - stop avoiding cats, even attracted to them
  - host manipulation
  - host extends phenotype
- parasites not always predatory
- "It's good to think with."
- not a freeloader
- feeding is not a relationship
- lurkers
- superorganisms
- Licklider's Man-Computer Symbiosis: fig tree and wasps
- concepts as parasites on technology
- free as parasitic on proprietary, or vice-versa
- concepts, e.g. freedom, well worked on
- concepts
  1.  show me the code (optimistic solutionism)
  2.  technology is ideology (mystification)
  3.  all technology is politics (constructivism)
  4.  everything new is old again (pessimistic dismissal)
- all miss: concepts are malleable, not just technologies
- the more we implement freedom, the more we change it
- "Concepts themselves are malleable, right, not just technologies.  And The more we implement freedom, the more we change it.  The more we think what we're doing with our technologies is enhancing or spreading or changing it, the more we actually have an effect on what that concept is, what it reveals to us freedom can be and what kinds of freedom it creates in the world."
- better to change a concept than criticize it
- recursive publics
  - internal components, e.g. shareable code, legal hacking, definition of open
  - external variables, was a different open source, e.g. mobile, services, internet topology, cultural status of remixing
- two concepts and how they've changed with implementations

## Freedom
- we talk about everything in terms of freedom ... frustrating
- 1992 Apple PowerBook ad
- freedom of speech concerned with freedom of the internet itself, net neutrality
- free software: perpetually struggling to disambiguate itself
- also freedom from computers
- freedom app: shuts down internet for however long
- freedom as a statecraft, imperial power
- revolutions in North Africa
- What kind of freedom?
- not all the same kinds of freedom
- jingoistic freedom?
- versions of freedom
  - libertarianism
  - negative liberty
  - positive liberty
  - Republican liberty
  - equal liberty
  - individual/collective freedom
  - liberalism
  - political freedom
  - moral freedom
  - free will
  - ethics as a practice of freedom
  - freedom as novelty
  - freedom as something _doable_
- Isiah Berlin: "little interpretation it seems able to resist"

### Libertarianims
- default mode of critique: Silicon Valley, Ayn Rand, Libertarianism
- not correct, but truth in it
- not correct of free software

### Negative Liberty
- Berlin's _Two Concepts of Liberty_
- negative liberty: zone of individual coercion, prevention
- Who governs me? v. How far does government interfere with me?
- positive liberty: individual must attain, "freedom _to_"
  - "no better than a specious disguise for brutal tyranny"
- evil, by most definitions, to restrict freedom in the name of freedom
- books:
  - Fred Turner
  - Thomas Streeter
- bureaucratic, instrumental reason, organization man, military-industrial complex
- symbols of protest
- view shared by people in the industry
- mainframe culture as the problem to rebel against
- Licklider
  - galactic net
  - had interactivity
- Douglas Engelbart
  - positive liberty augmenting human intelligence
- Seymour Pappert, Alan Kay: association with education, childhood ... whether they wanted to or not
- Ted Nelson's Computer Lib / Dream Machines
  - you can and must learn computers now
- IBM later AT&T
- DEC, PDP who represented resistance from within
- technological innovation system as the enemy
- innovation could restrict freedom
- "bootstrapping"
- Apple made good on promise of positive freedom
- convenience, ease of use, toward computer lib
- populist corporate paternalism

### Individual/Collective Freedom
- Rawls, _A Theory of Justice_
- Time-Shared Operating System
- equity
- freedom from batch processing
- "computer utility" comes back every five years or so
- TCP/IP protocols, administratively bounded networks
- UNIX

### Civic Republican Freedom
- Machiavelli, Rousseau, de Tocqueville, US founders
- freedom from domination
- paradox of the contented slave
- also reject negative liberty
- vendor lock-in
- proprietary lock-in
- switching costs
- antitrust
- arbitrary power to interfere if they want

### Freedom and "Free"
- in English
- libre and gratis
- good reason for confusion in American English
- paying is to assert autonomy and anonymity
- to be given something is to submit to an obligation
- saved by another's generosity
- some people don't want to be saved

## Participation
- less well understood
- differentiate:
  - collaboration
  - cooperation
  - altruism
- difference: supposed to bring benefits to the one who participates
- got a loop in it
- collaboration can happen without you benefiting
- cooperating can mean you lose
- raising hands
- creature of the 20th century, Google n-gram
- "representation", "democracy", "collaboration"
- May 1962: "participatory"
- lots of histories
- heternoyms of participation
   - worker participation
   - participatory design
   - methexis
- 1962: Students for Democratic Society, Port Huron statement
- normative theories of participation
  1.  educative dividend?
  2.  participate in goals as well as tasks?
  3.  maintain control or ownership of resources produced?
  4.  capacity for exit?
  5.  metrics of participation?
  6.  provide the capacity for communication?
- answers imply what participation means

## Parasites Revisited
- opposition of free and proprietary
- relying on narrow understanding of freedom and participation
- free living stage of the cycle of free software
- for a decade: appeared to have broken free, in its own environment
- right for one stage of the life cycle
- we're back inside the rat
- cloud computing, Silicon Valley
- infect its brain again, manipulate it, become free-living entity again
- several cycles before
  - PC versus mainframe, but got proprietary OS &c.
  - UNIX and open networks, but got incompatible version of UNIX
  - free software frees us from UNIX, legal revolution
- don't think free software will ever spread everywhere
- cycle just repeats
- new people: always more of this kind of work to be done
- too much focus ... internal community ... not enough focus ... infects and manipulates
- could say same for participation

## Q&A
1.  Which font did you use?
  - Graphic
2.  Friedrich Kittler
  - realm of possibility of freedom dictated by technology we adopt
  - we also have the ability to explore how to affect technology
  - cloud computing
  - GPL doesn't really work for cloud computing
  - "How do we infect cloud computing practice with the same principles of free software ...?"
3.  Is cloud computing the right target?  Managing your own information.  A lot of your personal information managed by someone else.
  - e.g. hypervisor
  - alive and well within cloud computing, but have this other information, private information
  - can we solve the problem the same way?
4.  building a free internet, bigger predators, best tech to fight GMail etc. is AdBlock
  - diversity central in healthy ecosystem, evolution
  - the world Silicon Valley is creating right now
  - monopolizing, reducing diversity
  - does this cyclically
  - fight back to produce more diversity
  - may also be other ways besides open source and free software
5.  (in Spanish)
  - trying to figure out difference between participation within group and general-universal participation
  - tend not to believe the latter exists
  - scale and modularity
  - patterns of participation
  - Carol Pateman: "patterns of participation in society"
  - local patterns build to create better patterns at the political level
  - participation, not just downloading
6.  anything predefining the next iteration, does current definition of proprietary software hold within it the next definition of freedom
  - agnostic on such theories
  - technological determinism, conceptual determinism
  - if it happens, it's fundamentally local
  - not autonomous
  - function of maintenance
    - undervalue
    - underappreciated
    - hidden
    - if that stops ... it's not seeds of own destruction ... it's that we stopped maintaining it
  - understanding the human component
  - about as Marxist as I get
7.  (inaudible) ... startup culture ... attacking one specific strand in "Silicon Valley" ... revival ... "sharing economy" ... expand on weight of this strand of political thought ... can we reduce it so?
  - clarification: Silicon Valley and startup culture
  - if you go there, you will discover worlds and worlds of difference
  - what's wrong with Silicon Valley is its media presentation
  - enhanced by journalists
  - always looking for pundits telling us what will come next
  - all kinds of people in it
  - associating libertarianism with Silicon Valley is unfair to other 90%
  - "Why does the media and why does the discourse around it automatically come back to this punditry?"
  - problem with lots of areas of our culture
  - What about media startups in New York?
