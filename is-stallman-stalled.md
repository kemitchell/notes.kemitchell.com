- "One of the Greatest Programmers Alive saw a future where all software was free.  Then Reality set in.
- nine years of free does not mean free of charge
- software that has no secrets
- privacy v. being a good neighbor
- "I don't think that people should ever make promises not to share with their neighbor."
- tail-chasing recursive acronym
- $350k in grants
- hired staff of programmers and technical writers
- sells manuals and tapes
- Cygnus Support
- "learned long ago not to make promises about delivery dates"
- lawyers negotiated 2 years with CMU to use Mach for GNU
- "Ironically, the problem now is money---the very thing that Stallman is trying to avoid."
- in good times, people pay for tapes as quasi-donations
- recession on
- grants dried up
- let people go
- managers as leeches
- finish GNU, not to make money
- Hal Abelson: "As far as I am concerned, if it makes this GNU OS and then closes down, it will have been a complete success."
