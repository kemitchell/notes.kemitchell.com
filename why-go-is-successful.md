- simplicity
- Lang.Next conference
- languages adding features from other languages
- Sapir-Whorf/Relativity controversial
- matters in programming
- language convergence, thought convergence
- languages evolve and compete by adding features
- "bloat without distinction"
- Go 1: language is fixed
- adding features will not make Go better
- make Go less different
- designers had very different backgrounds
- consensus on feature to get it in
- readability most important feature
- thinking about which features to use
- readers recreate that thought process
- more complex language makes code hard to understand
- features are fun to play with
- long-term maintenance, large-scale programming
- APL: easy to write, hard to understand
- expressiveness and expense
- e.g. map and filter
- encourage wasteful code
- vector space: find basic set covering
- orthogonal features combine well
- for scalable cloud services
- "server infrastructure"
- guidelines for language compelled choices
- representation of a gopher
- more detailed gopher drawing less appealing
- Go is actually complex, but it feels simple.
- simplicity as art of hiding complexity
- GC: best example
  - no interface
  - stack maps &c.
  - isn't even in the spec
- concurrency
- constants
  - constants are just numbers, not strictly typed
  - hard to design
  - blog post
- interfaces
  - no data, just methods
  - dynamic type assertions not in original spec
  - not thrilled with assertions, but pretty good
  - most distinctive practical feature
- packages
  - hard to design
  - months
  - interactions
  - best after concurrency
- example
  - Unicode
  - `Fprintf` to a network connection
  - promotion func/method
  - concurrent
  - production ready
- clarity is worth the fight
- making things simple is hard work
