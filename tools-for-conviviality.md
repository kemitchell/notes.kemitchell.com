- > Above all I want to show that two-thirds of mankind still can avoid passing through the industrial age, by choosing right now a postindustrial balance in their mode of production which the hyperindustrial nations will be forced to adopt as an alternative to chaos. (ix)
- > Our analysis of schooling has led us to recognize the mass production of education as a paradigm for other industrial enterprises, each producing a service commodity, each organized as a public utility, and each defining its output as a basic necessity. (x)
- > When an enterprise grows beyond a certain point on this scale, it first frustrates the end for which it was originally designed, and then rapidly becomes a threat to society itself. (x)
- scientific discoveries used two ways
  1.  specialization, institutionalization, centralization
  2.  "enlarges the reach of each person's competence, control, and initiative, limited only by other individuals' claims to an equal range of power and freedom"
- > We must come to admit that only within limits can machines take the place of slaves... (xii)
- > _Such a society, in which modern technologies serve politically interrelated individuals rather than managers, I will call "convivial"._ (xii)
- > _I have chosen "convivial" as a technical term to designate a modern society of responsibly limited tools._ (xii)
- notes on choice of "convivial" (xii)
- > Tools foster conviviality to the extent to which they can be easily used, by anybody, as often or as seldom as desired, for the accomplishment of a purpose chosen by the user. (22)
- > This unqualified identification of scientific advance with the replacement of human initiative by programmed tools springs from an ideological prejudice and is not the result of scientific analysis.  Science could be applied for precisely the opposite purpose.  (34)
- > The principal source of injustice in our epoch is political approval for the existence of tools that by their very nature restrict to a very few the liberty to use them in an autonomous way. ... The possibility of a convivial society depends therefore on a new consensus about the destructiveness of imperialism on three levels: the pernicious spread of one nation beyond its boundaries; the omnipresent influence of multinational corporations; and the mushrooming of professional monopolies over production.  (43)
- > People must learn to live within bounds.  This cannot be _taught_.  (65)
