# Introduction
- Eben
- freedoms
- four freedoms
- users' freedoms
- consensus about how workers relate to users
- pressure in investment community and businesses
- asking for better-balanced market
- undoubtedly going to continue to occur
- threat to consensus or evolution of consensus

# Opening Statements

## Heather Meeker
- "alternative licenses"
- pressure
- challenges due to what has happened in the software industry
- worked well for a long time
- not going anywhere
- cloud-based implementation
- triggers for conditions not triggered anymore
- economic pressure on makers of software useful in the cloud
- "I'm a software licensing lawyer."
- "what I've been doing for most of my career ... is write proprietary licenses"
- doing diligence on open source is easy, doing diligence on proprietary license is hard
- primary product
- get my lunch eaten
- "openish approach"
- we really need better proprietary licenses ... standardized ... understandable
- get people to release code that make the source code available
- preserve some of the freedoms if we can't preserve all of them
- project to standardize proprietary licensing
- will have a lot in common with open source licenses
- make it a big tent
- vilifying people who try alternative models is the same us-versus-them paradigm that caused a lot of pain for a lot of years

## Jim Wright
- Oracle is used to dual licensing
- bemused indifference
- interesting to observe attacks
- came from private practice
- consensus is license do not conform to majority view of open source
- to the extent that the social environment of open source development has at times been hostile to anything that is less than completely open source this comes as no surprise
- moment of reckoning
- companies that release open source software need to make money
- models to make money which may require license changes
- not all of us have found that the copyleft model doesn't work
- "I have seen these changes as a user."
- consternation ... promulgation of these licenses prior to any community discussion or consensus
- implications for use across multiple afffiliates
- networks of intercompany agreements
- containerized distribution
- don't think that license proliferation should prevent us from advancing the license ecosystem
- don't need to stand still
- careful consideration
- lot of assembled lawyers ... probably benefit the people who are trying to make these innovation
- color me ambivalent

## Sarah Ward
- MongoDB
- rationale: seen a lot of companies, particularly international cloud providers, who are willing to test to the boundaries of that license
- offer MongoDB as a service without contributing any code back
- choices:
  1.  closed source
  2.  source available
  3.  find open source alternative
- Server Side Public License
- additional provision: if you offer as a service, you have to open source the components of that service
- submitted to OSI, ongoing
- criticism of timing of the choice to send to OSI
- we understood that introducing a new open source license would be controversial
- the only way that we could stay in the open source community that made sense for our business
- starting point for conversation
- open to iterating, based on feedback

## Richard Fontana
- currently on board of OSI
- term is up in a few months
- thankless job
- de facto manage the license approval process
- institutional guarantors of meaning for ... "open source"
- dilution of meaning
- important for Red Hat
- have never been so concerned about license proliferation
- we should not be afraid of experimentation
- Jim's license has added something to the suite of licenses
- UPL iterated over many months
- very short, simple license
- experimentation is good, but depends on the way in which it's done
- concerned about way rolled out
- deception and misleading communication
- "commons clause" suggestive of Creative Commons
- Creative Commons as an anticommercial license
- commercial freedom has always been a core value
- first version of Linux kernel
- 1980s
- didn't succeed in the software realm
- taking a standard model of licensing .. tacking on an anticommercial restriction
- may mislead developers
- commons license to an enclosure of a commons
- Redis Labs has a page promoting modules, quite some time after said under OSI-approved licenses
- experimentation should be done in a multilateral way by a lot of stakeholders
- troubled by taking project that so many depend on and changing master branch to new license before vetted
- very disruptive to users of MongoDB
- what is the appropriate boundary of copyleft within the open source definition ... free software definition
- this should be done in a very public way with input from developers and companies ... before commercially significant software is placed under these new licensing models

## Heather Meeker
- disagree that what Redis did is misleading
- go ahead and look at the site
- similar initials doesn't make things misleading

## Richard Fontana
- oversight
- may have been corrected

## Jim Wright
- speaking as a consumer: having to disentangle stuff
- have to tell people using Redis, need you to look at every single module
- representations to customers
- radioactive
- cleanly separate

## Karen Copenhaver
- we would not be here without the work of unbelievable developers
- Stallman through kernel developers
- infrastructure of business models
- certain assumptions
- the value that they brought is why we're all here
- astounding to think about what has been achieved in a number of decades
- a few threats to commercial embrace along the way
- e.g. FUD
- talking to each lawyer at each corporation
- huge process
- license proliferation ... lost the value of these community resources
- diminishing value of resources because
- proprietary licenses are _far_ more complex
- based on a confidence in the use of some shared resources in a frictionless manner to develop infrastructure
- responsibility to preserve expectations of developers and engine of creativity (infrastructure)
- going back to a time where people are afraid to use this stuff because it's chaotic
- new people coming in think that creating something new, that old things not essential to the magic that has happened
- we have never been able to force corporations to do anything with their IP and we never will
- use the assets because they were so excellent
- been through dual licensing and other things for many years
- I cannot identify very many of these absolutely fundamental successes that came out of those models.
- do good things, e.g. employment
- if that's all we had, we would not be celebrating peace today

## Jim Wright
- some of us still like dual licensing
- well established projects may go closed source at any moment ... to potential obligation to maintain those things entirely on our own
- the FUD ... the fear ... risk ... very high
- shut down tomorrow to my teams

## Mishi Choudhary
- camouflage proprietary licensing
- Why do developers continue to work in these business models?

## Heather Meeker
- Commons Clause is not camouflage proprietary licensing, it's proprietary licensing.
- definitional problem
- no good word for something that's in the middle
- unless it's morally repugnant ... come up with some more useful terms
- EULA for Word versus source code, do whatever but X
- different from what most of us think as proprietary
- ultrastrong copyleft, a different question
- has all the freedoms, just argument over scope of copyleft
- different discussion
- not accurate to call it camouflage proprietary
- How broad should copyleft be?

## Sarah Ward
- healthy skepticism
- we are a commercial enterprise
- want to maintain relationship with developers
- wouldn't be submitting to OSI if we didn't think we're still adhering to those principles

## Mishi Choudhary
- business decisions
- trend: copyleft to address very narrow range of competitors?

## Sarah Ward
- we have actually tried to draft so that it's more broadly applicable
- that's much harder
- there are already open source licenses that apply different to different use cases
- not necessarily a problem

## Heather Meeker
- will see more of noncommercial-type restrictions or similar
- negotiating a merger agreement in the middle of the night
- definitions of things like "noncommercial" is extremely challenging
- Creative Commons struggle
- precious little guidance
- not faulting them for it, it's difficult
- worthwhile to come up with community consensus
- saying "these people can't use it" not robust enough
- that breaks down in a year
- can't identify the people anymore, merge and change

## Richard Fontana
- Red Hat perspective
- Red Hat can't practically distribute software that's only under open source licenses
- hundreds of licenses that have never been approved
- so much legacy stuff
- all kind of conform
- range of restrictiveness and permissiveness
- what we think of as open source is a certain limited set of combinations of possible conditions and freedoms
- our customers can't practically be expected to read every line of every license of every piece of software ... that we ship
- comfort
- committed to a kind of definition ... with rare exceptions ... only shipping ... conform
- SSPL: such a severe restriction
- only affects a narrow scenario
- practically difficult problem for customers
- can't say that AGPL represents the outer bound anymore
- consistency of Red Hat's picture to customers
- commercially impractical to understand every license

## Eben Moglen
- people experiencing significant commercial disruptions
- we want to listen to the problems of the businesses
- GPLv3 made mostly by listening to businesses
- we would break no business model if it could be avoided at any cost
- TiVo didn't think we meant it.
- should not come out of users' rights
- "users' rights should be regarded as the key reason that all of this works in the first place"
- "subsidize commercial difficulties on the back of users"
- I do not think that the consensus ... is going to break down.
- social contract with workers is really important
- not clear that workers will agree to produce unfree software at the same prices
- enormous wage from freedom
- relicensing activities, not people building a better mousetrap and licensing it proprietary
- signing up to compete with themselves
- usually works out badly
- why do the forkers not fork?
- so the market works
- part of our responsibility to help businesses struggling with the conditions we created
- cheating on users' rights in order to help businesses solve business problems

## Mishi Choudhary
- what does license stewardship mean?

## Karen Copenhaver
- focusing on shared community assets
- OSI process is one piece of preserving the OSI definition
- confusion between OSI definition for what a license is and what expectations of developers are around development process
- honor developers' expectations
- terminology very valuable to them
- life work invested in
- destroying the value of it because we want a little bit of the glitter to cover other things
- isn't an obvious steward for many popular licenses
- what does the MIT license mean
- short of litigation we don't know what a license means
- litigants not concerned with impact on community as a whole
- we run our communities based on the developers' expectations

# Summaries

## Richard Fontana
- experimentation is very valuable
- I've tried my hand at a simpler copyleft license
- what copyleft should look like in an era of cloud providers
- has to be done publicly and multilaterally
- shouldn't be done by single corporations relicensing a very valuable project under a new license before it's been adequately vetted
- boundaries policed by organizations very important
- "open" has a pure development process meaning now, very much tied to legal meaning, the license meaning of "open"
- concerned about dilution
- commercial advantages would start to be endangered

## Heather Meeker
- spending decades talking people off the ledge about open source
- I'm not here to say that we need to change open source.
- would love to hear input on improving proprietary or doing something new

## Sarah Ward
- I speak for one company
- there is a threat with the cloud era
- a ton of businesses are interested
- have needs to address in the interim while the public process is occurring

## Jim Wright
- the existing models still work pretty darn well
- for many of us, the copyleft is functioning just fine
- we are getting the code contributions back
- reaction of community should be to ... one at a time
- willingness of developers to experiment isn't something that should generate vitriol
- we can continue to work on this as a community just like we work on the code as a community

## Eben Moglen
- even the fights sound different in an era of peace
