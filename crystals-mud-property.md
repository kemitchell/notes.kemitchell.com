- hard-edged doctrines, e.g. loan default ("crystals")
- Bentham: nothing but a basis of expectation
- the more important the thing, the more likely hard-edged rules
- won't bother to mine the commons without clear entitlements
- Indians invented rights in animals for fur hats
- economic scarcity story
- fuzzy, ambiguous rules ("mud")
- muddied by exceptions, equitable second-guessing
- Prah v. Maretti: sunlight rights
- nuisance
- facts and circumstances
- wealth transfer and clarity shifts uncorrelated
- era of increasing muddiness

## Examples

### The Demise of Caveat emptor

- latent defects
- habitability
- CA: must disclose mass murder on property
- private crystals through waivers
- circle: crystal-mud-crystal again
- courts sometimes ban waivers

### Real Estate Contracts

- very hard original rules
- courts of equity
- "by the growth of equity on equity, the heart of the common law is eaten out"
- equity of redemption
- installment land contracts
- relief from forfeiture

### Recording Systems

- first in time, first in right
- Statute of Enrollments
- "race" statutes
- ninnies, hard-luck cases, scoundrels
- non-record notice
- Torrens method with certificates

## Tentative Explanations

### One or the Other

- 80s: legal academics into crystals
- Pareto
- discourage rent-seeking
- dissipate resources in conflicts or bullying or defenses against bullying
- ex ante v. ex post
- CLS: excessively crystalline
- Duncan Kennedy: rules v. standards
- tell the bad man the limits of his badness
- fairness is ex post
- Do we even have a choice between mud and crystals?

### Economics

- transaction costs
- mud where transaction costs high, e.g. many parties
- but we fall back on mud for low transaction costs situations, too

### History

- P.S Atiyah:
  - British contract law
  - long cycles
  - "principles"
  - discipline unruly populace
  - "pragmatism"
  - "individualized justice"
- Albert Hirschman
  - Shifting Involvements
  - reactions to each other, not external events
- long contracts
  - nobody reads
  - all contingencies
  - get it in writing
- simplicity draws too many uses, or too complex set of uses
- booby trap

## Forfeiture

- mud to crystal decisions: strong moral judgment
- antipathy to debtor forfeiture of land
- loss disproportionate to lapse
- abhorrent
- James Gardley:
  - unequal exchanges disfavored
  - market price is "equal"
  - random redistributions
- Mark Grady:
  - last clear change in tort
  - double-clutching
- forfeiture: overloading of crystals
- fools and sharp dealers systematically overload crystalline rules
- overuse of the commons of crystal rules leads to mud
- extensions of crystals to other contexts ("overloaded")

## ...

- Stewart Macauley:
  - parties have no long-term relationship
  - correlates to fool-scoundrel
- Ian Macneil
- game theory repeat play
- history: commerce dominated by Jewish and Quaker merchants whose religions ensured reliability
- law caught up, empowered those without ties 
- mud: post hoc readjustment
- each descends from nonlegal commercial context
- "rulemaking"
- judges see everything ex post
- things matter, we crystallize, overloading leads to forfeitures, we muddy boundaries
- start over when stymied

## Rhetoric

- dealings with strangers
- one-shot deals are rare
- mud as substitute for negotiation
- administrative costs
- harken back to different kinds of relationships
- Enlightenment crystals
- entitlement and self-interest v. fellow-feeling
- CLS critique
- Enlightenment: hoped commerce would increase sociability, create communities
- altruism
- sturdy courage
- UCC: "commercial reasonableness"
- more clear to businesspeople than crystal rules
- metaphor or rhetoric
