## Quotes

> ... kings attract us by affection, aristocracies by good sense, and democracies by freedom." (25)

> He [Cato] used to say that no genius of such magnitude had ever existed that he could be sure of overlooking nothing; and that no collection of able people at a single point of time could have sufficient foresight to take account of everything; there had to be practical experience over a long period of history. (35)
