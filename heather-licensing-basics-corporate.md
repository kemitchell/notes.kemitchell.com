## Important Licenses
1.  GPL
2.  BSD
3.  MIT
4.  Apache 2.0
5.  LGPL
6.  EPL, CDDL, MPL

- two types
  1.  permissive (esp. Apache foundation): If you distribute, provide notice.
  2.  copyleft (esp. Free Software Foundation):  If you distribute, use the same terms and provide source code.
- unrestricted: all rights under copyright law

### Permissive
- permissive: most companies allow with little or no legal review

### Copyleft
- not "viral": outdated, inaccurate, misleading
- distribute binary: source, same terms
- distribute source: you're done
- tutorial for non-coders
  - source code
  - executable/binary/object code
  - compiler
  - "Open source is a techno-political movement that guarantees access to source code."
  - operating system as traffic cop
  - applications
  - Linux kernel, an operating system
  - user space as virtual sandbox
  - some software only in source form
  - View page source.
  - dynamic v. static linking
- GPL: all or none
- LGPL: just the library
- kernel
  - more permissive components
  - LKMs must be GPL
  - user space
- weak: designed to be easy to comply with
- separate file, don't change
- distribution
  - legally unclear
  - but lots of practice
  - one copy to another person
  - software as a service
- even if you don't distribute
  - most companies won't use software under these licenses
  - costs of monitoring compliance
  - network copyleft licenses
  - Affero GPL

## License Notices
- most important part of compliance
- not complicated, but can be a lot of work
- example on Samsung phone
- text files in top-level folders
- may have hundreds
- need a game plan
- your notices must be in or with your product
- challenging
  - IoT
  - consumer electronics
  - vehicles and heavy equipment
  - products with no UI screen
- written for pre-Internet, on-prem software

## Company Policy
- look at your policy
- Blue Oak Council policy
  - one for larger company
  - one for smaller company
- stop-go-caution list
- What do "stop", "go", and "caution" mean?
- anti-TiVo and embedded
- consumer electronics the most conservative
- companies with large patent portfolios conservative
- larger companies tend to leave approvals to engineering managers
- smaller companies involve legal more

### What to Do
1.  stop-go-caution
2.  get approvals
3.  keep track of your use, usually automated

### Contributions and Releases
- follow company rules
- most employees don't have authority to release
- business justification

## Enforcement
- most enforcement is informal
- public lawsuits tip of iceberg
- community organizations, e.g. SFC, LF
- focus on compliance
- other kinds of enforcers
  - strategic enforcers: against competitors
  - dual licensors
  - copyright troll, in Germany, for monetary damages
- embarrassing
- bad publicity
- trouble recruiting, reputation
- compliance is the right thing to do
- developers deserve the benefit of their terms

## Importance
- understand what is in your product
- know your BOM
- most failures because developers don't know what's in their product
- hand-in-hand with security issues
- investors or acquirers will require certification of compliance
- may even audit
- customers want assurances
- signal of technical expertise
