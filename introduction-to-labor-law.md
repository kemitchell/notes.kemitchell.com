## Overall

A thoughtfully structured, admirably succinct fly-by tour of high-level labor concepts and a few specific rules.  Very easy to recommend to readers without legal background.

If I had to guess, I'd say the other leans union, rather than employer.  Frustration with NLRB reversals comes through strongly.

## Follow-Up Items

- authorization cards (43)

- "zipper clause" (66)
