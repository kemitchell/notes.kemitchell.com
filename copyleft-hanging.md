- "What is the difference between a 'license' and an 'agreement'?"
- "The concept of terms and conditions that accompany open source software being a license, rather than an agreement, is an unconventional concept to most lawyers. Not surprisingly, the initial treatment of this issue by courts has been inconsistent."
- license to use Berne to make enforceable worldwide
- "A license is in essence a covenant not to sue." citing Pamela Jones, ["The GPL Is a License, not a Contract, LWN"](https://lwn.net/Articles/61292/)
- Jacobsen v. Katzer
  - conditions, not covenants, despite affirmative obligations
- > Many software licenses contain limitations or requirements related to the "use" of the software, despite "use" not being one of the exclusive rights granted under copyright law.  Most practitioners would argue, and these authors believe that most courts would agree, that the failure to comply with a use limitation in a license agreement is the failure of a license condition, rather than the breach of a covenant---at least in most software licenses.
- Versata v. Ameriprise
  - opposite conclusion
  - copyright preemption Fifth Circuit test:
    1.  within subject matter of copyright
    2.  extra element not element of a copyright claim
  - held: "viral" GPL requirement an extra element
- not all open source licenses are licenses
  - e.g. CPL
  - e.g. EPL
