- second hire and former CTO
- The Economies of Open Source
- bomb dropped: Entropic
- never had a conf speaking moment like that
- had no idea how crowd would react
- a bunch of history people don't know
- started in 2009
- never needed to know where it came from
- because I was an insider, I could talk about
- costs money to run
- Laurie: could run npm for 99 years for the amount Uber burned in a quarter
- still a notable amount of money
- $30k+ in AWS per month
- have to have a story
- free is relative
- it just works
- leave out a little dish of milk
- worked on the technical side
- where they money came from, why the money had to be there, what the consequences
- took all of our commons ... handed them over to a company that's VC-funded
- I was totally OK with this at the time.
- I thought we'd be OK.
- my realization that I was fundamentally wrong
- I made a mistake.
- don't regret pushing Node
- fantastic team
- npm team was just fantastic people
- in the service of the wrong cause
- underlying profit motive
- when you take VC money, you are in it in order to give the VCs a payoff
- completely open transaction
- you can't opt out of that once you've handed over a chunk of your company
- control
- sometimes that's exactly the right trade-off
- current company: VC makes perfect sense
- not a short-term project
- not go big or go home
- you can't shut down with the thing that all of JavaScript needs to keep running
- VC sustained it for years
- centralized the commons
- got involved when they raised
- probably wouldn't have got involved without it
- people don't do that for free
- npm was a tire fire, down all the time, nine sixes
- needed serious attention and serious operational work to stabilize
- hard to get that from human beings
- on-call 24/7
- most other language systems haven't done this
- CPAN
- RubyGems is volunteer-run
- expectations are very different
- the scale .. possible because had a team of professionals
- npm support was and is legendary
- empathetic, customer-centric people
- most time supporting open source users
- people came to expect like a SLA
- uptime
- volunteers get forgiveness
- they may not be awake
- up, fast, professional support
- It was a company.  It could do this.
- unthinking use level
- only in last six months or so seeing chinks in armor
- why is this a problem?
- incentives not aligned with yours
- Node part of OpenJS Foundation
- community resource
- funded by corporations, but not by any one corporation
- turtles climbing over each other
- checks and balances
- where the community needs Node to go is where it goes
- the things we give away to each other ... to build the web with
- advertising from npm client
- VCs would proudly suggest to npm
- package maintainers doing that, backlash
- find some way to get the money
- Adam: "great adventure"
- Adam: payback process
- New Master
- if you come up with a product that pays the bills
- wouldn't be having conversation if found a way to monetize
- couldn't turn their biggest expense into income
- nearly exponential download graph is cost
- solid engineering work, not brilliant
- turned it mostly into linear costs but still continue to rise
- goal of new CEO was to turn costs into profits
- got really rocky
- he's an interesting character
- surprisingly to me still the CEO
- questioned assumptions in useful and healthy way
- earth-shaking: Why do we have to run the public registry?
- Host: "let's just turn this cost thing off"
- give the cost thing away
- why did everyone work there? to run the public registry.
- mission-driven
- the public registry was why I cared about my job
- high impact on the world and developers

## Entropic
- problems litany in talk kind of depressing, then announced Entropic
- open source federated package manager and CLI for JavaScript

- Mastodon's concept of ActivityPub
- runs a Mastodon instance

- problems with data model
- knew the problems with the API
- let's keep working on the mission
- whoever does this next doesn't need VC money

- Dominic Tarr
- give them back their stuff
- sell access to it if they want to make money
- want OpenJS Foundation to run an instance
- something people can run themselves
- Chris' brain melting out of ears writing sync algorithm
