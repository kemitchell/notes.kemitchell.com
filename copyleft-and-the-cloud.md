- not a Google, Samba, of Conservancy talk
- surprisingly strong feelings about this
- What does Free Software mean?
- big distinction with open source
- grew up in Sheffield
- access to source of everything I used, e.g. university workstations
- "that's 'open source'"
- for technocrats --- arrogance
- "You can't read code? Your problem!"
- "I get code. That's what I wanted."
- GCC encounter
- difference: FX expands that freedom on behalf of users
- "They get exactly what they want. This is all they ever wanted."
- MIT printer story, 2020 edition
  - support sends RMS to GitHub repo with GPLv2 source
  - Richard sends a PR
  - firmware isn't modifiable
  - model out of support, no updates coming
  - offer to brick remotely for discount on latest model
  - RMS just as helpless as a non-programmer
- involved in GPLv3, especially anti-DRM provisions
- excellent license
- "It's a complete failure."
- AGPL even more soundly rejected
- seen as troublemakers
- "we would go back to GPLv2 if we could"
- most common AGPL use case: a la Microsoft Shared Source
- poison pill license
- "Licensing freedom is a complete failure."
- same experiment, expecting to work next time
- tedious audiophile, but no magic cables
- surround sound system
  - "custom Linux-based OS"
  - no source offer
  - not bad people!
  - they don't even know
  - What is the point of trying to enforce?
- trying to stop the tide like trying to stop proprietary use of open software
- stop depending on licensing
- "Licensing does not work."
- "Enforcement does not work."
- SFC is never going to enforce a license on these things
- great for B2B, not individuals
- invidiauls will lose to VMWare
- get rolled
- FSF resuses to use GPLv2 for glibc
- Jeremy's tipping point
- FSF: would make the project less popular
- true of Samba
- "courage of none of our convictions"
- licenses only used for coalescing communities
- The Cloud
  - The FSF completely and utterly missed the move to the cloud.
  - missed move to the Web before it
  - development in the 1990s
  - the dark ages
  - now: open source components on massive distributed machine, talking protocols
  - "Nobody cares about linking. Nobody even thinkgs about linking in software development."
  - protocols
  - documentation of Microsoft protocols
  - interwtwined protocols
  - reimplementable protocols
  - Wiundows "one of the most open systems on the planet today."
  - everything in and out fully documented
  - committed to fixing spec issues
  - protocols matter, not licensing
  - "documented, interoperable protocols are how software works today"
- SMB
  - Microsoft
  - Samba
  - bunch of other implementations that died
  - until Microsoft documented everytying
  - explosion of new implementations
  - proprietary OK!
  - "This is a space that is working."
  - free choices for all components
  - use open client with closed server and vice-versa
  - quality of implementations
- interop the new frontier
- engineering solution to a political problem ... never works ... only solutions I know how to build ...
- now: open source over proprietary, sometimes open protocols
- hybrid, multicloud only possible with documented protocols
- DRM to lock down interop.
- if a vendor wants to lock down, they can
- enlightened self-interest
- NFSv4 treading water, SMB growing
- carrots over sticks
- IoT abandonment problem
  - pulling support for products
  - can't recycle
  - bricks
  - Logitech Squeezebox
    - abandoned by manufacturer
    - released server
    - can still buy servers today
    - FLOSS extending lifetime
    - environmental impact
- PC architecture
  - built today's software industry
  - next for cloud
- Q&A
  - implementations will have bugs
  - security review of specs
  - embedded deviceds may still have license pressure
  - companies will go to any length to avoid users installing other things on their devices
  - "open source technocrats"
  - apply pressure once it talks to a web service
