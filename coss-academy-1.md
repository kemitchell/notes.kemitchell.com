- Heather: fundamentally a tactician
- licensing got standardized
- 6-8 licenses
- proprietary licensing is ad hoc
- implementation
  1.  signed
  2.  break seal
  3.  click to accept
- "frictionless"
- avoids formalities
- circumvented procurement
- crisis of control
- frictionless licensing anticipated Internet
- genius: binding license without formalities
- v. contract
- conventional wisdom was click-to-accept (ProCD)
- Freedom 0
- OSD amplifies
- unrestricted licensing
- outside open, pretty blurry
- "proprietary" not useful
- categories
  1.  open
  2.  binary
  3.  source-available
    - source code license, but no full Freedom 0
- expectation: Folks unwilling to do binary licenses. Conditioned.
- technology: scripting languages over compiled
- source-available needs to be professionalized
- Cambrian Explosion, esp. over last year
- cloud providers
- the brains behind the project and heading it
- handful of standard, limited, source-available licenses
- identified huge need
- everybody writing their own
- "I wish I had an open source license that was noncommercial."
- using CC-NC, but not software licenses
- "menu"
- "plain language"
- excise legalism
- no money for lawyers
- "buckets"
- most common variants
- open core
- "frosting" or "crust"
- all royalty-free
- adaptation
- e.g. Confluent
- SaaS as "binary" substitute
- similar from business point of view
- finer control as business grows
- new option: PolyForm for next layer up from open source
- use lawyer money for deals where you get paid
- putting self out of job
- only want to do things once
- YC standardization
- disintermediating lots of lawyers
- development as generalized forms
- customers have ideas
