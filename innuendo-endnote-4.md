## Talk
- white men promised success
  - doesn't apply to others: social liberalism
  - mathematically impossible: economic liberalism
  - should have been kept: Durden Syndrom
- attachment theory
  1.  Secure Attachment
  2.  Anxious Attachment
  3.  Avoidant Attachment
  4.  Disorganized Attachment
      - pain and comfort from same source
      - threat outside source of comfort
      - anxious dependency
- parasocial contact hypothesis
- engulfment: entire Internet life
- curation/search radicalization spiral
- research from former members
- not that many alt-right formers yet
- avoiding diatribe: sound smart, no sense, Jordan Peterson
- through-terminating cliche: from brainwashing research, Ben Shapiro
- peripheral-route processing: secondary characteristics, delivery
- direct-route processing: assess content
- alt-right, like modernism, label for a trend
- How aware are they that they are recruiting to the alt-right?
- know they get neo-nazis in Q&A
- Stochastic Terrorism
  - increase likelihood of violence
  - don't tell them to commit violence
  - no control or culpability
- authoritarians
  1.  leaders
  2.  followers, very different people
- every part of recruitment and retention plausibly deniable
- created collaboratively, on the fly
- rapidly mutating virus
- Stochastic Totalism
- caveat: art degree

## Q&A

1.  PewDiePie

2.  Internet enables or making possible; Plato said democracy leads to authoritarianism
    - 2013: sudden drop in patriot and far-right groups, just as social media took off
    - cycle of hate group:
      1.  traction
      2.  true colors
      3.  dissociation
    - Internet subverts the cycle
    - rebrand and keep moving
    - The song is very old.

3.  Donald Trump groomed to alt-right?
    - yes, but to what degree intentional?
    - claim: we memed this rando into the White House
    - perfect plausible deniability: is he smart enough to do any of this on purpose?

4.  repeating history, 1930s Germany, Treaty of Versailles sanctions, declining US standard of living
    - economic precarity can also lead to leftism
    - US: more like to veer right
    - slavery, Indians
    - also use economics to justify right positions, e.g. you don't have a job because immigrants
    - can't ignore the culture war

5.  combatting
    - When I know I'll tell you.
    - not there yet
    - prior talk
    - individuals:
      - point of connection
      - share world view outside debate
      - talk about yourself
    - public debunking:
      - different track
      - don't include person making argument
      - truth-first strategy, not misrepresentation first

6.  platform responsibility, the Russians
    - personal policy: don't prognosticate
    - need to be regulated
    - legal system doesn't understand tech
    - cops: What's Twitter?
    - sanctions that hurt, not CODB

7.  tactics to reach populations vulnerable to alt-right
    - go back and forth
    - we already outnumber the right
    - put energy in underrepresented allies
    - "You gotta come to us" attitude
    - right weaponized anger of politically disengaged
    - now: maybe intervene
    - talk to your mods
    - pass policy now to prevent what's coming
    - don't over-focus on vulnerable populations
    - both worth doing
