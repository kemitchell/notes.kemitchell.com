- inbound and outbound licenses
- "exercise copyrights"
- "recipients"
- license to the project
- water flowing downhill
- inbound=outbound or CLA
- inbound=outbound: recursive, elegant
- CLA: inboudn >= outbound
- CLAs work differently for permissive and copyleft projects
- Apache 2.0 versus Apache CLA
- most common CLA
- copyleft:
  - in=out prevents license changes
  - against privatization
  - CLAs controversial
  - change outbound license
  - into proprietary products
  - dual licensing doesn't work with inbound=outbound
- click-to-accept, e-mail, any way to form a contract
- GitHub terms of service implement inbound=outbound
- CLA Assistant
- CLA v. permissive:
  - patent scope
  - delegation
  - notice deduplication
  - enforcement, mostly for copyleft
  - warranties, rarely invoked
- DCO
  - not really a CLA
  - copyleft, in=out
  - e.g. kernel
  - original work
  - Doesn't grant rights. That happens in GPL.
