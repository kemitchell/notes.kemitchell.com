- Founder Talk 61
- Changelog 355

## What is npm?
- "a way for JavaScript developers to share modules of JavaScript code"

## Why no foundation for JavaScript?
- side project for four years
- on donated infrastructure from IrisCouch
- scale was too massive
- foundation was an option
- find a home in some big company
- scale and rate of growth led to private company
- astronomical rates of growth
- $2m wouldn't do it
- increasing investment needed
- growth story is good story to tell VCs

## What do you sell?
- orgs: multitenant Saas to store private code
- smaller companies or front-end teams within larger companies
- $7/user-month
- enterprise: single-tenant instance of the npm registry and website
- single sign-on
- security policy enforcement
- big companies

## What kinds of companies use enterprise?
- sweet spot: 50+ developers
- do some segmentation after sectors
- sell to anyone who wants it
- fair amount of inbound
- really high compliance needs
- e.g. finance
- also: internal agency model
- web dev team with multiple properties under one brand
- also: tools team or platform team in charge of reused code

## Everyone knows npm, but how do you mention paid, sales?
- fair bit of outbound marketing
- double-edged sword
- npm versus npm, Inc. and npm Enterprise
- people have heard of the thing but they haven't heard of the product
- continually beating the drum
- we have things for you
- internal champion, usu. engineering architect or engineering manger
- champion intuitively understands
- make the case to others

## Almost better to start a company around open source you don't write?
- host: community team versus product team?
- Isaac: I disagree.
- challenge: continue to make good on community mission, while serving product interests
- design our product interests to be served by open source community
- missteps
- intuitive: "open source team"
- create unhealthy dichotomy, even in own thinking
- resentful of five engineers
- every new thing: give this away or charge for it?
- after 5.5 years: that's the wrong question
- better way: What is the free thing that will get someone to pay for this?
- upgrade path
- best companies: explicit goal that individual devs never pay, but company almost always
- team of ten writing proprietary application
- can give good folks a coupon, not a problem
- Orgs: free if open source
- easy transition: individual, group, then group working on paid product
- free Orgs increased paid Orgs sign-ups
- had given some projects an Org and marked it free in database
- people at companies would sign up, add their whole team, try it for an hour, and flip the paid switch

## Honor system?
- no, anything you published free to the world

## Had to invent a business around this.  What to charge?  Had to pivot on pricing model several times?
- didn't pivot on pricing model
- did make subtle changes
- mostly around UX
- 2016, 2017: Orgs originally a subscription that belongs to a particular npm user
- org would have owner, an npm account
- problem: what happens when they go away?
- had to go through the support team
- every time someone has to contact support is a mistake
- back to drawing board
- how do users think this works?
- organization itself is the billing entity
- some users would have to start paying
- collected cases, gave a coupon
- basically no reaction to e-mail about pricing adjustment
- all over the map on pricing
- self-serve data gives you a lot of data
- easy to throw a survey out there
- looked at GitHub
- very sticky after first five users
- enterprise: almost no data
- difficult to get data
- "call us"
- arm wrestling with procurement
- whatever we can get out of you is the price
- $50 a seat to start
- many more features
- minimum seat count to qualify, 20
- pricing not as way you make money, but a filter and a signal
- without 20, you won't use most of the features
- "give me the one in the middle"
- start high and let them push you down
- don't think cheap is legit

## Migrating from open to business
- not in the top 10 hardest things
- more art than science
- price where you won't go bankrupt
- specific number matters less
- pricing of wine
- completely arbitrary

## Hardest challenges
- split-brain separating free/open/community from paid
- pernicious
- gets in everywhere
- on-prem and saas at same time early on
- will need on-prem eventually
- bottom-up has to be SaaS
- big if blocks in product
- tell yourself it's the same product
- fork in place worse than actually forking
- still have legacy on-prem
- losing money on every sale
- pivoted
- make SaaS offering out of registry &c.
- make sure the codebases don't diverge --- heard from GitHub people
- that is absolutely going to happen
- on-prem means top-down sales or really easy to install on a laptop, will need professional services
- bottom-up gets to bottom, bottom-up gets to top
- almost never from both sides at once
- usually successful started one way or other

## Approach to building team
- one guy in Thailand, one in E Europe
- video and chat apps were not as good then
- focused on Bay Area
- office in Oakland because that's where I live
- adding remote was hard when everyone in Oakland
- IRC to Slack
- more time zone coverage
- hiring remote prompted more distributed work style
- big beautiful office with four people in it
- rented a bigger space when hit 13 and felt cramped
- landlord wanted to move them within the building
- how about we just leave?
- 2019 prices? Yeah, go.
- a little bit sudden, fell in lap
- 100% remote
- everybody works from home
- freed up capital
- monthly allowance for WFH
- get a lot of resumes, esp. in tech roles
- hate "non-technical", they're profoundly technical jobs
- same things everybody does
- networks: pro and con
- diversity goes off a cliff
- in-crowds
- executive search a couple of times
- LinkedIn, Lever, social media

## Advice for open source entrepreneurs
- doing the free thing actually serves your strategy
- no one weird trip
- pile of honey near ants
- disrupting an ecosystem
- no ants are complaining, but good or hazardous
- no balancing
- have to be on thing in your mind
