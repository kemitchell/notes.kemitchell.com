- Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Amazon as de facto regulators
- "The technologies underpinning the internet were all developed here in the United States."
- "The surveillance business model has eroded user trust to such a point that it is impeding our ability to innovate."
- Denmark appointed ambassador to Silicon Valley
- "we do not have the capacity to keep such large collections of user data safe over time"
- "our ability to attack computer systems far exceeds our ability to defend them, and will for the foreseeable future"
- analogy to early nuclear industry
- two views of privacy:
  1.  data privacy
  2.  "sphere of life that should remain outside public scrutiny"
- "cannot opt out of it, any more than we might opt out of automobile culture by refusing to drive"
- "not the guardians of privacy, but its gravediggers"
- GDPR: very traditional view, people own their data
- "The plain language of the GDPR is so plainly at odds with the business model of surveillance advertising that contorting the real-time ad brokerages into something resembling compliance has required acrobatics that have left essentially everybody unhappy."
- "Frankenstein's monster of consent"
- "Google waited until the night before the regulation went into effect to announce its intentions, leaving ad networks scrambling."
- "Overall, the GDPR has significantly strengthened Facebook and Google at the expense of smaller players in the surveillance economy."
- "Personally identifying information has a way of seeping in to odd corners of computing systems..."
- erasure v. backups
- "inadvertent experiment conducted by the New York Times" in non-targeted ads
- "But if you can't opt out, what does it mean to consent?"
- "Despite being a domain expert in the field, and spending an hour clicking into these policies, I am unable to communicate what it is that Tumblr is tracking, or what data of mine will be used for what purposes by their data partners (each of whom has its own voluminous terms of service)."
- IABE defeating spirit of GDPR
- machine learning
- jigsaw puzzle: missing one piece, know what it is
- "As it stands, the consent framework exemplified in the GDPR is simply not adequate to safeguard privacy."
- "Privacy regulation should be understandable."
- "Users should not be required to make complex and irrevocable decisions about privacy."
- "should not punish people for seeking privacy"
- "strict lifetimes for behavioral data"
- Google setting to "automatically delete location data after three or 18 months"
- "Tech startups in highly regulated areas of health, finance and banking should be required to compete on the same regulatory footing as established businesses in those areas."
- "end run" around with ML
- "What is missing from the regulatory landscape is a legal mechanism for making credible and binding promises to users about privacy practices."
- preserve our liberty
- Uygur Autonomous Region, Integrated Joint Operations Platform
- "Never before has a government had the technical means to implement this level of surveillance across an entire population."
- "The latent potential of the surveillance economy as a toolkit for despotism cannot be exaggerated. The monitoring tools we see in repressive regimes are not 'dual use' technologies---they are single use technologies, working as designed, except for a different master."
- not "Orwellian" but "Californian"
- "There is no deep reason that weds the commercial internet to a business model of blanket surveillance. The spirit of innovation is not dead in Silicon Valley."
